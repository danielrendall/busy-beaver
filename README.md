# busy-beaver
Quick and dirty implementation of a Turing machine to run Busy Beaver solutions.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver for background.

Written in a couple of hours on a bank holiday Monday. Run the main method in the TuringMachine object. Should be reasonably
obvious how to create a set of states.
